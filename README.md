Recursive Find

## How to Build and Run

To load the chrome extension:
navigate to 'chrome://extensions/' in your chrome browser
tick the developer mode switch in the top right corner of this page
click on "Load Unpacked" and select the root directory of the project folder

To compile and run the backend:
navigate to the root directory of the project folder in your terminal
run 'mvn package' to compile the project and run the test suite
run the command './run' in this same directory to start the backend server

Once this backend server is running, return to the chrome browser
open up the chrome popup using either 'ctrl+shift+f' or simply by clicking the magnifying glass icon in the top right corner
At this point the project should be functional for use in most webpages

When finished:
exit the backend by returning to the running process in the terminal and using 'ctrl+c'

**NOTE: The plugin works with recursion depth 2 most quickly. This is recommended. Any depth beyond a level of 2 will be slower.
